# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
# 
# * print("2+2=4")
# * print("2-2=0")
# * print("2/2=1")
# * print("2x2=4")

# In[4]:


R = (3*4)+5
#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
print(R)


# In[5]:


#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
hours = 200 / 60
print(hours)


# **Objectives:**
# * Python
# * C
